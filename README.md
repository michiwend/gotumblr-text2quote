gotumblr-text2quote
===================

a simple go app that converts all text posts of a tumblr blog into quote posts. I wrote it for a one-time use, it did well on my blog. Nevertheless it's far from being well tested!

###Features:
  * fetches ALL text posts (automaticly walks trough paged responses)
  * stores the posts in a backup file
  * deletes every text post and creates a new quote post with the same date/time
